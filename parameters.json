As he was walking outside he accidentally forgot what he was doing and took my pill (in his defense he takes a lot of vitamins each day). He walks over to me with a panicked look on his face telling me he took it. He asked me if he was going to pass away and what’s going to happen to him. I tell him he'll be fine but he doesn’t believe me and goes to the side yard and tries to make himself throw up. So I sat there just crazy laughing while he was wretching behind me."
