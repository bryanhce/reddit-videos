#     guys idk if u noticed it anot, but i realised many girls in their teens years they tend to want to have birthday parties with their friends at their homes. like literally everyone will come dressed in nice fancy dresses and their parents rlly prepare nice fancy cake and nice fancy decos for the birthday party especially the 'age balloons' thing (e.g. '19' for 19 year old girl) and the streamers and all. like i dont understand whether their family is super rich or smth or their parents are super rich or smth that they're so willing to spend alot of their money so that their daughters can have a nice quality time with their friends for their birthday party whereby they invite 10+ friends over to have fun and then u see the instagram stories on it. if u are a girl kindly enlighten this guy as to why yall do this and why your parents are so willing to do this, cos the tradition in my family is birthday just have a nice fancy meal outside to celebrate with the family, cake is optional and don't need to make the occasion so fancy. i thought having birthday parties was a stage that you'll grow out of after primary school, and even in kindergarten and all my family didnt even have birthday parties for me and my brother. our only 'birthday party' whereby we invited other ppl to come was during our one year old birthday LOL, then birthdays is kinda a low profile thing in my family. POV: im a guy which explains why i dont understand this haha. our birthdays we tend to celebrate in a quite simple fashion and we're quite chill about birthdays.
